To use this app you first need to make sure you have installed the dependancies for console table, express, dotenv, inquirer, and mysql. Once that is finished you can invoke the application in the command line by entering node index which will present you with the options for this specific employee tracker crm. You can use the arrow keys to view all Departments/Employees/Roles while also being to add new ones in all of those categories as well.
